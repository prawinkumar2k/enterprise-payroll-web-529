## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-12
### 🚀 Final Production Stable Release

This milestone marks the transition from a Beta Release Candidate to a professional-grade enterprise desktop product.

### Added
- **Production Installer (NSIS)**: Native Windows installer with custom paths, desktop shortcuts, and clean uninstaller.
- **Secure Secret Engine**: Dynamic 64-byte JWT secret generation persisted on first-run (no hardcoded secrets).
- **Audit Hash Chaining**: Implemented SHA256 "Immutable Ledger" logic for tamper detection in audit logs.
- **Automated Backup Engine**: 7-day rolling daily database backups to `%APPDATA%`.
- **Migration Framework**: Idempotent SQL migration engine for future schema updates (v1.1+, v2.0+).
- **Auto-Update Engine**: Integrated `electron-updater` for background version checks and notifications.
- **Integrity Validation**: Startup verification for both SQLite data health (`PRAGMA`) and Audit Chain links.
- **Production Metrics**: Internal stability, performance, and usage profiling without "Beta" UI overhead.

### Changed
- **Branding Upgrade**: Replaced all "Internal Beta" and "RC" markers with professional "v1.0.0 Stable" indicators.
- **Governance Shift**: Converted Safe Mode UI into a refined "System Recovery Engine".
- **Stability Metrics**: Transitioned from blocking beta warnings to internal reporting and developer diagnostics.

### Fixed
- Fixed critical syntax error in SQLite schema initialization that prevented production migrations.
- Resolved potential secret leakage by moving to a dynamic, machine-bound secret generation model.
- Hardened server endpoints with production-ready security headers (`helmet`) and restricted request payloads.
