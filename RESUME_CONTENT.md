### **Project Title: Enterprise Payroll & HRMS Ecosystem**
**Role:** Lead Full-Stack Engineer / Desktop Architect

**Technical Highlight Summary:** 
Designed and implemented a high-performance, offline-first desktop application for payroll automation, featuring advanced reporting engines and secure hardware-bound licensing.

#### **Key Technical Contributions:**

*   **Desktop Engineering (Electron & React):** Architected a standalone desktop solution using Electron that handles sensitive payroll data locally. Integrated a production-ready installer pipeline with automated versioning and update capabilities.
*   **Advanced Reporting Engine:** Developed a custom React-based printing engine capable of generating multi-page, high-fidelity A4 reports for Bank Statements and Payroll Registers, featuring a professional screen preview system.
*   **Secure Hardware Licensing:** Built a machine-fingerprinting service to protect commercial software integrity. Implemented hashing algorithms (SHA-256) to bind licenses to specific CPU/Disk hardware IDs, preventing unauthorized distribution.
*   **Adaptive Database Architecture:** Engineered a dual-database management layer that dynamically switches between SQLite (for local desktop isolation) and MySQL (for cloud-based enterprise scaling) without changes to the core business logic.
*   **Payroll Intelligence Dashboard:** Created a real-time analytics hub with data visualization for tracking workforce growth, net salary disbursements, and statutory compliance (EPF/ESI/IT).
*   **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Implemented comprehensive audit logging and a secure JWT-based authentication system within the Electron environment to ensure data privacy and accountability.

#### **Core Tools & Technologies:**
*   **Languages/Frameworks:** JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Node.js, Express.
*   **Desktop Development:** Electron, Electron-Builder (NSIS).
*   **Database:** SQL (MySQL, SQLite), Knex.js.
*   **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Recharts (Analytics).
*   **DevOps:** Git, GitHub Actions, Docker.
